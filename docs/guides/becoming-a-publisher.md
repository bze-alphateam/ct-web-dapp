# ü§ù Becoming a publisher

## Overview

To publish an unlimited number of articles with minimal costs, only the standard BZE blockchain transaction fees, you must become a publisher. This is possible only through a governance proposal. Once the proposal is up for voting, delegators can cast their votes to determine whether it benefits the chain and the community to have you as a publisher.

## Recommendations

BeeZee is a welcoming community ready to support anyone keen on offering valuable content through CoinTrunk. We strongly encourage you to join our Discord server for assistance. If trust is established, we're eager to help you submit your proposal and earn the necessary trust to obtain your publisher status.

## Submit the proposal

The proposal must be submitted through the CLI, including a title, description, a name (which will appear on your publisher page), the publisher's address, and a flag indicating its active status. Following this, you can proceed with the deposit and voting process as typical for governance proposals.

After the proposal is approved, your address is recognized as a publisher on the blockchain, granting you the right to publish unlimited articles.

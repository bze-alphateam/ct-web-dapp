### Changing the blockchain(network)

The wallet supports multiple blockchains, and users can switch between them by tapping on the current network in the main wallet screen. This action opens the 'Select Network' screen, where users can choose a different network. By pressing the 'switch' button, the wallet will transition to the selected network.

### Copying your address

Tapping on your address in the wallet main screen will copy your address to your clipboard, making you able to easily share it.&#x20;

### Balances and assets

The balances area displays all assets owned by the current address along with their respective balances. The wallet automatically updates balances when sending or receiving coins. However, due to varying network conditions and device capabilities, updates may be delayed or interrupted. In such cases, you can refresh the balances by pulling down on the asset list.

Users can search through assets list using the search input present above the asset list.

## Stake Screen

The 'Stake' screen is accessible from the wallet's main screen by tapping the 'Stake' button. This screen first displays any existing delegations, followed by a summary of the balances, including spendable balances and delegations, and a total. Below this, there are two buttons: one to claim all rewards from all delegators and another labeled 'Delegate,' which opens the 'Delegate' screen.

The user can search for a specific delegation by entering the validator's name in the search input at the top of the screen.

### Delegate screen

On the 'Delegate' screen, users can delegate their coins to a specific validator. The process is straightforward: press 'Pick Validator,' choose a validator from the displayed list, enter the amount you wish to delegate, and tap the 'Delegate' button. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Always remember to keep some spare change available for future transactions.**</mark>

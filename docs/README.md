## Overview

**CoinTrunk** combines a blockchain module and a user-friendly application. The blockchain module operates seamlessly on the **BeeZee** ([https://getbze.com](https://getbze.com/)) blockchain, supplying data for the mobile app's news feed. The mobile application delivers news from the Cosmos ecosystem and offers wallet features for Cosmos SDK blockchains.

The wallet is **self-custodial,** which means all funds are entirely under the user's control. The mnemonic generated at wallet creation facilitates wallet recovery or transfer to another wallet, while the password secures the wallet's private keys. The private key and mnemonic **NEVER** leave the wallet, ensuring that CoinTrunk or BZE developers do **NOT** have access to any wallet information. It is **impossible** to recover a lost mnemonic or password. Always ensure you back up your wallet and password in a secure location.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**No representative from our team will ever ask for your private keys, mnemonic, password, or funds under any circumstances!**</mark>
